# sarcastic-text-for-cli
I hate typing that by hand, so I made a tool for it.

## Overview
This command-line utility converts plain text into "sarcasm text," altering the capitalization based on specified inversion settings. The tool lets you control the degree and pattern of capitalization inversion to achieve your desired level of sarcasm.

## Install
No additional dependencies are required.
```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

To run the sarcasm text converter, use the following command structure:
```bash
make-sarcasm [text] [args]
```
or if you prefer to not install it:
```bash
python3 sarcastic_text/main.py [text] [args]
```

### Options

- `TEXT`: The text you want to convert to sarcasm. Required.
- `--inversion_factor`, `-f`: Specifies the intensity of case inversion. Ranges from 0 to 100. Default is 60.
- `--inversion_penalty`, `-p`: Adjusts the penalty for consecutive inversions. The default is 35; higher values mean fewer consecutive inversions.
- `--allow-same-case`, `-a`: Permits resulting text to be entirely in the same case (all upper or all lower).

## Examples

1. Basic example with the default settings:
    ```bash
    make-sarcasm I am excited to use this tool
    ```
    Output might look like: `i Am EXcITeD tO UsE THiS TOOl`

2. Example with custom inversion factor and penalty:
    ```bash
    make-sarcasm This tool is quite amazing -f 80 -p 50 -a
    ```
    Output might look like: `tHiS TOOL Is QUiTe AmAZiNG`

Adjust the inversion settings to achieve various styles of sarcasm text as desired!
